# Arduino Learning Box

An interactive learning box designed to simplify and enhance the experience of using Arduino — especially for teenagers or anyone with no prior programming experience.

## ✨ Overview

The Arduino Learning Box provides an intuitive, hands-on environment that makes electronics and coding more accessible and fun.  
It lowers the barrier for beginners by simplifying wiring and connections, offering a more interactive way to experiment with Arduino projects, and encouraging learning through exploration and creativity.

## 📚 Features

- Simplified wiring and connections: reduces complexity for beginners.  
- Plug-and-play components: easy setup with minimal prior knowledge.  
- Interactive and educational: helps users understand how Arduino works through practical exercises.  
- Ideal for first-time programmers: geared toward teenagers or people without prior programming background.  

## 🧰 What’s Inside / Structure

Describe here what’s part of the box:  
- Arduino board (e.g. Uno / Nano)  
- Wires, sensors, modules (LEDs, buttons, sensors, etc.)  
- Breadboard or simplified connector interface  
- Example sketches / code examples in `/códigos_arduino`  
- A guide / tutorial (e.g. in `/roteiro`) to help get started  

*(Adapt to match exactly what components you offer.)*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A computer with USB port  
- Arduino IDE (or other compatible IDE) installed  
- Basic familiarity with connecting hardware (but no programming experience required!)  

### Setup & Usage

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB.  
2. Upload one of the example sketches from the `códigos_arduino` folder.  
3. Follow the steps in the tutorial/guide (in `/roteiro`) to connect components and test circuits.  
4. Experiment: change code, add new components, try different configurations — learn by doing.  

## 📦 Technologies & Tools

- Arduino (C/C++)  
- Breadboard / Connector setup  
- Standard electronic components: LEDs, resistors, sensors, wires, etc.  
- (Optional) Documentation / guide written in Markdown  

## 🧑‍💻 Who Is This For

This project is ideal for:  
- Teens exploring electronics for the first time.  
- People curious about programming and hardware, but without prior experience.  
- Educators or mentors who want a simple, ready-to-use kit to teach basic electronics and coding.
